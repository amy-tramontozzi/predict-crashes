The script analyzes traffic crash data to explore factors contributing to serious accidents and to predict crash frequency. The data is categorized into crash types based on injury severity and environmental conditions, such as weather and roadway surface. A summary dataset is created, grouping crashes by date and calculating metrics like the number of serious crashes, proportions of crashes under poor road and weather conditions, and temporal variables such as day of the week and month. A negative binomial regression model is built to predict the daily count of serious crashes using predictors like road and weather conditions, day of the week, and month. Model performance is evaluated using RMSE, and predictions are compared to observed crash frequencies.
